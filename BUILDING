BUILDING

Clone the git repo locally

  git clone https://github.com/tonkuijt/cronton.git

cd into the work dir

  cd cronton

Run make to build the binary and the configs

  make

After make is done, read the readme (Yeah, right) and edit the config file cronton.conf to suit your needs.

Then, running the binary with

  ./cronton

starts the binary where it will sit and wait until the time has come to do stuff.

If you'd like to start over, a

  make clean

removes all built files so you can start over.
